### Learning Rust!

This language has been on my mind for a while, and I decided to go for it!
At the moment I'm reading this great book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition.
As for now the projects and challenges as described in these books might end up in this repo!
If I decide to keep learning Rust this repo might include more challenges / projects in the future besides the ones mentioned in the book.
